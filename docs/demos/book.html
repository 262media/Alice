			<p style="color: #fff; text-align: center;">CSS3 Book Effect</p>
			<br >
			<br />
			<p style="text-align: left;">To whomever is viewing this please note the following: The pages flipping back does not work in mobile browsers yet or in 
				safari likely because of the event listener, the code is a disaster area but it should be resolved shortly and made all pretty. The current 
				build requires webkit but will shortly support most browsers. <br /> Though it is not currently integrated with Alice JS that will not take long to do.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Arrow keys will flip through the pages as well. Please note that this entire book is using CSS3 and its 3D capabilities. If your browser doesn't 
				support this, this will do nothing.</p>
		</div>
		<div><p>Page 3</p></div>
