## How to Use

To use the Alice library:

1. Click on the **Downloads** button at the top right of this screen.
2. Select **Download.zip** and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **alice** (e.g., **C:\webworks\alice**).
4. Open the downloaded zip file from step 2 and **extract the contents from inside the top level folder** to your new **alice** folder.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the **alice** folder (e.g., **C:\webworks\alice\config.xml**).
5. Using an achiving utility (e.g., [WinZip](http://www.winzip.com/) or [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)), package the contents of your **C:\webworks\alice** folder into a zip archive named **alice.zip**.  This archive should have the application assets (not a folder containing the application assets) at its top level.
6. Using the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Tablet OS](http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/webworks.jsp)**, package the **alice.zip** archive into a BlackBerry Tablet OS application using the following command line: **bbwp c:\webworks\alice\alice.zip**
